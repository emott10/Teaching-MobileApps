# APPLICATION NAME
Complete description and overview.  This is where you describe in a brief, yet clear and concise, manner what your product should do and how you expect it should be used.  Why did you write this application?  What purpose does it serve?  It's okay if the only purpose is to meet the homework requirement (but try to move bedyond just that - be creative!).

## System Design 
This is where you specify all of the system's requirements.  This section should accurately portray the complete operation of your application.  Provide scenarios, use cases, system requirements, and diagrams/screenshots of the system.

## Usage
This is where you explain how to use your application

## Description and overview
I wrote this application because of the homework but I didn't want to do a post-fix. The reason for that is because I wanted to be able to show it off to my non-computer savy friends and family. This calculator serves the purpose of getting my foot into the door of app development, I know this app isn't the most sophisticated as most calculators on the app store but I feel very good about the progress I have made over a week and a half.

## System Design
The calculator was tested with Android 7.0 on the Nexus 5 and Galaxy S8. My calculator is a simple pre-fix calculator that will take two numbers and add/subtract/multiplie/divide two numbers, which after pushing enter you can either start over or  add/subtract/multiplie/divide to that answer. The calculator does not calculate multiple operation expressions.

## Usage 
Pick any number and the tap the operation you would like to use then pick another number and push enter, this will give you the answer if you want to do another operation on the answer then just tap what ever operation you would like to do and then pick another number and push enter. Other then that then the app works like a regular calculator should.
