# iFindIt
iFindIt is a game based on the Google Vision API which asks the user to find a certain object and if the object is in the picture the user took (based on the API result) then the user gets 10 points, if the object is not in the picture then the user has to retry. The user wins by getting 30 points total. The app will let you know how long it took the user to get the full 30 points so the user can improve the time in the next play through. The purpose of the making the game was to create a fun and entertaining game that anyone can pick up and play.
