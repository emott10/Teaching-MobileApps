# JumpyJump
 JumpyJump is a Doodle Jump like game that uses the the accelerometer to control the player and the point of the game is to get as high as you can while jumping from platform to platform without falling off the screen. I decided to pick this game because I thought it was a good starting point for using Unity for the first time. The point of the game is just to have fun and try to get as high as you can! As well as game for me to get used to Unity with.

## System Design 
Requirements:
1) Android Phone with accelerometer
3) Minimum Android 4.1
4) Target Automatic (highest installed)
5) 24.669 MB Storage space

There is no menu screen at the moment, so right when you open the app you get a splash screen for Unity and are thrown into the action!


# Galaxy Shooter
This game I made with the help a tutorial (https://www.udemy.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-game-development-with-unity/learn/v4/overview), I wanted to be transparent about that up front, but this tutorial help me a lot with understanding the basics of unity and supplied the assets for the game. I still have not finished it yet (that is why the game is not 100% complete either) this is because I wanted to start my own game for project 4 before the deadline was up. The point of this game, like JumpyJump was to get Familiar with unity and make a cool game. I do plan on finishing the tutorial and game at a later time. How you play the game is simple, you can use the accelerometer to move the ship and touch the screen to shoot (something I had to figure out, because the tutorial was just making a PC version of the game). The player has 4 lives (one when start and three extra) which you can see your three extra lives in the top left hand corner and if you hit an enemy ship you lose one and this is shown in the top left as well. You get ten points for each enemy ship you kill. There is no time limit or end, you finish the game when you run out of lives. There are also three power ups that spawn randomly: Triple shot (gives you three laser shots instead of one), Sheild(puts a blue shield around the player and makes the player invulnerable from one ship hitting the user), and Speed boast(which boasts the player speed for a set anount of time). When the player dies the logo screen pops up and the player can tap again to replay with the lives and score reset.

## System Design 
Requirements:
1) Android Phone with accelerometer

4) Target Automatic (highest installed)
5) 45.30 MB Storage space

The game starts with the logo screen and the player just needs to tap to start a new game


While in game enemy ships will spawn and the player can tap the screen to shot them, while moving with the accelerometer to dodge the ships or pick up the power ups
